# RollCallMaker
After analyzing all aspects we came up with a solution of automating attendance system by
implementing QR based attendance system.
● This would change the traditional method of manually recording attendance by calling names into fully
automated and efficient system.
● RollCall Marker contains three interfaces one for faculty,another for student and one for admin.
● The faculty interface lets professor to create a session according to subject code and section of current
class.
● On the other hand the student interface after successful login creates a QR that is unique for every SAP
ID.
● When the scanner in the faculty interface scans QR of students ,it accordingly marks attendance in
database of the particular day.
● The students now are able to mark their attendance all by themselves which saves a hefty amount of
time ,is easy to operate and saves wastage of resources.
● Also for the purpose of preventing proxys, our app doesn’t allow taking screenshot of the QR code page.
